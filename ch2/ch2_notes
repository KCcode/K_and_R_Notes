Basic data types
   char
   int
   float
   double

Compound types
   arrays
   structs

Other qualifiers such as:
   short 
   long

Constants
Integer constant: 1234
Long constant: 123456789L
Unsigned constants use U or UL(unsigned long)

Floating point constants
f or F indicate float constant
l or L indicate long double constant

Enumaration constants
Offers the same uses as writing #define
enum boolean {NO, YES} /*Takes default values NO = 0, Yes = 1*/
enum months {JAN = 1, FEB = 2, ...} /*can assign the values*/

Declarations
const double e = 2.71828182 /*indicate that this value wont change*/

Implicit type conversion
converts type to the "bigger" data type to avoid losing data

Bitwise Operators
& bitwise AND
| bitwise exclusive OR
^ bitwise exclusive OR
<< shift left //fills vacancies with zeroes
>> shift right // fills vacancy with zero or signed bit depending if it is a signed or unsigned value
~ one's complement

Example:

x << 2 shifts the value of x 2 bits to the left
